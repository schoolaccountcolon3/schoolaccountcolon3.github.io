# Holy Unblocker (temporary host)

This site was meant to be a temporary host from when Holy Unblocker initially shut down (2022-03-01),
before it was bought by The Gopher (2022-04-07).
Initially it was thought that Sylvie (EnderKingJ) would aquire HU, but this never ended up happening.
Between the 2 dates mentioned above, I set up this site in an attempt to maintain Holy Unblocker's SEO.
It turned out it wasn't really needed, and I forgot to take it down. Oops.

2024-01-22: epic stuff coming soon hopefully.
